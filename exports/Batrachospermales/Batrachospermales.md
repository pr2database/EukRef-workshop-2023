For the Batrachospermales most family and subdivision information has been updates as well as a majority of the genus and species information, but that was not colored. Just incorporating columns A-K of the metadata should be accurate. The three rows that are red are fungal contamination and likely should just be removed or added to a fungal dataset for annotations.
